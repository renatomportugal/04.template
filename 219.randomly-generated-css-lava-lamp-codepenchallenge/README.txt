A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/rRBMKj.

 This weeks `CodePenChallenge` is all about blobs. I figured I'd have a go at the lava lamp as an opportunity to try out gooey filters 👍

The blob characteristics are randomly generated on each load via random CSS variables passed inline through the markup. This means you'll get a different lamp on each load.

Enjoy!
