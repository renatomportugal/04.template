 Move using the arrows and cross the street avoiding the gray rectangles

The game have 8 maps, when you pass the last one, goes back to the first, and so on.

Made in a afternoon.

I didn't have time prevent diagonal moviment, so don't use it. haha 

Update: Change the maps to prevent a cheat; If die more than 4 times goes back to the previous map.

Update 2: Smaller size of the canvas; Show the number of 'hearts' in the middle of the rect; more particles;
