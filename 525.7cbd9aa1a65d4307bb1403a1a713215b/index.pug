        strong Weightlifting. 
        | Weights are a core part of CrossFit. We do a lot of olympic-style lifting with a barbell, like cleans and jerks. Deadlifts, squats, and presses are also fundamental.

        | Jumping rope is a great warm-up, but can be part of a workout too. We level up to double (or even triple!) unders.

      p
        strong Rings. 
        | A ring muscle-up is the goal. Ring rows are also a stepping stone to pull ups.
