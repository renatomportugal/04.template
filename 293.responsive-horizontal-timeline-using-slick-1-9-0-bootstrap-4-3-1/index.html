            <p>On May 17, 1956, Lippert Components, Inc. (LCI®) was founded as B&L Industries. Together, Larry Lippert and Don Baldwin formed B&L Industries. Don and Larry began manufacturing galvanized mobile home roofing, creating a product called Duratop. Detroiter Mobile Homes and Redman Industries were B&L’s first customers. In 1957, Don sold his shares of B&L to Larry. The strong foundation laid by Larry led LCI to develop many innovative technologies and improve industry processes.</p>

            <p>Towards the beginning on the decade, LCI struggled to pay bills and expansion projects were temporarily put on hold. In an effort to rebuild existing plants and to fund additional expansions, Larry entered into a deal with William “Bill” Redman. Bill’s son, Donald Redman, became managing partner of B&L Industries, alongside Larry, in exchange for cash to rebuild the plants and to fund additional expansion. Shortly thereafter, B&L Industries expanded into Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia and Michigan. B&L’s corporate office moved into a larger building in Alma, MI, the old Alma Products building. In 1964, Larry bought out Donald Redman and once again became sole shareholder of B&L Industries.</p>

These acquisitions would be crucial to attaining Skyline’s manufactured housing business decades later. The names of the aforementioned businesses would soon disappear, along with B&L Industries, to be replaced by Lippert Components, Inc. (LCI®).</p>

            <p>Riblet Industries becomes a publicly-traded company, forcing LCI and Riblet to divide their assets between the two companies. With the flip of a coin, it was decided that Riblet would own and operate the facility in Burton, Kansas and LCI would own and operate the Henderson, North Carolina facility. This division would prove to be instrumental for LCI’s future growth: In many ways a sheer stroke of luck, North Carolina would soon after become a major hub for the manufactured housing industry. Clayton Homes and Oxford Homes became major players in the manufactured housing industry, boosting LCI’s sales to all-time highs. This began a kind of “golden age” in the manufactured housing industry. With the business now thriving, LCI further expanded into Kingston, Tennessee.</p>

Skyline would quickly become LCI’s largest customer, allowing LCI to supply all of their manufactured home chassis, chassis parts and galvanized roofing products. By the end of 1988, LCI’s sales grew from $45 to $80 million annually.</p>

            <p>Hurricane Andrew devastated families in and around Homestead, Florida, requiring 18,000 FEMA housing units to be built for misplaced families. LCI was called upon to provide chassis for the 18,000 FEMA units. 10,000 of those chassis were needed immediately. LCI teams rallied around the effort, operating three shift, 24 hour days for an entire year. With the sharp increase in demand, LCI’s facility in Florida increased chassis production from 15 to 55 chassis per day. LCI’s ability fluidly increase production capacity and to produce such a high number of chassis caught the eye of Drew Industries, a New York-based holding company that would eventually acquire LCI.</p>

Seeing a need for diversification, a young Jason Lippert, the son of Doug Lippert and grandson of Larry Lippert, received the green light from management to start a travel trailer chassis line in McAdoo, Pennsylvania. As fate would have it, this would become the single largest turning point in the company’s history. LCI is acquired by Drew Industries, a long-established investor in the manufactured housing and RV markets. Having acquired Kinro decades earlier, the LCI acquisition further strengthened Drew’s portfolio in the manufactured housing and RV industries.</p>
