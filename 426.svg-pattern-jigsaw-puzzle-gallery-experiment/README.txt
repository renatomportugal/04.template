 I was curious if I could create a jigsaw puzzle animation by placing the images in a SVG pattern and applying the pattern to a group of paths. This is the result.  Also used the new advanced stagger from GreenSock's TweenMax.

It chugs pretty slowly on mobile. I wouldn't recommend this in the wild. You could probably get away with it using smaller images, but this project is probably better suited for WebGL or canvas.
