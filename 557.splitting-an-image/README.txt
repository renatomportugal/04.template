A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/shshaw/pen/oOoLvy.

 Use [Splitting.js](https://splitting.js.org) to [split up an image by cells](https://splitting.js.org/guide.html#cells) for animation and layout with CSS!

## Splitting by cells
You can use `data-columns` and `data-rows` together to make a grid, or individually to get only vertical / horizontal cells.

`data-image` can be set to an actual image URL to use, or if set to `true`, Splitting uses the first `<img>` in the element.
