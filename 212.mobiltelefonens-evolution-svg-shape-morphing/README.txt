 Little experiment to try some basic SVG shape morphing.

First approach was to do the animation with SMIL, then [SVG-Morpheus](https://github.com/alexk111/SVG-Morpheus) came to my mind and I decided to give it try.

As mentioned on this article [how-svg-shape-morphing-works](https://css-tricks.com/svg-shape-morphing-works/) by Chris Coyier, the most important fact was to keep all shapes with the same number of points.
