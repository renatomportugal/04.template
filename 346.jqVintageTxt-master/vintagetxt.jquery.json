  "description": "VintageTxt is a fun little widget that lets you communicate a message to your website's visitors through a simulated monochromatic, scanlined interface - one character at a time.  There is also a styled input prompt to make it semi-interactive.  It's hard to explaing in words, so best just to view the demo. Enjoy!",
