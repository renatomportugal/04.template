# User-friendly Image Map Generation

The goal of this project is to create a simple plugin and set of tools that allows for the creation of image maps by end users without the need to write a single line of code. Polygonal shapes can be drawn over visible images, coordinates are captured, a map is generated and then saved as meta-information about the image.
