A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/ghostreef/pen/ZXjqJO.

 Trains will emerge from the bright green circle. Matching the train number and the station number, guide the trains to the right stations by changing the tracks along their way. Change tracks by clicking on the blue circles on the joints. Keep up, more and more trains will emerge with varying speeds. As you progress the map will expand and the trains will quicken.

Works best in Chrome. 
Works in Firefox, but it renders noticeably slower.

Let me know bugs / feedback. I didn't have any testers ha.

I recommend you fullscreen. There is no horizontal scrolling, so if the board doesn't fit on your screen, you'll have to change the map.

Every board is random and dynamically generated and every train sequence is random.

There are a total of 9 levels. With levels 8 and 9 being pretty challenging...to maybe impossible haha. Sorry if the trains collide, it is rare, and I try to prevent it in the code.

I used Aldo Crusher's designs for the landscape. You can check out more of his work here: http://aldocrusher.dribbble.com/

I used somebody's code for death, I can't find the author anymore, Codepen has since been flooded with Death Star pens. :(

Side note. The binary tree generator algorithm doesn't have any lookahead, so the taller it gets the more collisions occur. Heights of 10 or greater may cause the browser to crash lol. So be careful when customizing difficulty.
