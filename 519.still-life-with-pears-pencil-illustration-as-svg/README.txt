A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/brentmiller/pen/bZwYvx.

 I drew this vector illustration in Adobe Illustrator from an arrangement of still life. Illustrator's Charcoal Pencil brush gives the lines a pencil-drawn appearance. I then exported the SVG for use on CodePen.
