A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/jcoulterdesign/pen/MVyOoZ.

 This is my submission to the Dead Poets Society CodePenChallenge. I decided to do 6 animations to my favorite poems, mostly in CSS although the rain and grain filter are not. 

All credit for these bits go to

Canvas rain - https://codepen.io/ruigewaard/pen/JHDdF
Canvas grain - https://codepen.io/renarsvilnis/pen/YWKRvE

The rest of the site design, illustrations and animations were done by me. All audio is  free to use and the Crazy woman soundscape was created by me as it was difficult to source (it isn't me humming btw....).

Site works on mobile also, although audio will not start until the user first interacts. 

Enjoy!

Thanks
